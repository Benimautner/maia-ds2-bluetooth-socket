Here are my findings of the reverse engineered Maia Ds2 bluetooth protocol


# Setup
You need a device running python3 that is able to connect to a bluetooth device.
I used a Raspberry Pi but theoretically it should work on any device.

Raspberry Pi:

  -Prerequisites:
  
    -bluetooth (pip3 install bluetooth)
  -Connect the Amplifier to your Raspberry:
  
    -Either using the GUI or using rfcomm
    
  -Run the example and check if it is working.
